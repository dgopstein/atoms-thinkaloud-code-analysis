# Replication Package

This package is intended to offer transparency into the design, analysis, and
results for the paper:

_Thinking Aloud about Confusing Code: A Qualitative Investigation of Program Comprehension_

The information contained in this package falls broadly in to three categories,
each of which have received their own directory: preparation, interview_instructions,
and data.

## Preparation

* **instrument-0000.pdf**: An example instrument that could have been issued to a
  subject, but was not.
* **questions_snippets.csv**: A CSV listing every snippet chosen for inclusion in
  this study. Includes headers:
  * atom: Which atom of confusion is contained or removed from the snippets.
  * type: Whether the snippet contains an atom (C), was hypothesized but not
  confirmed to contain an atom (HC), has an atom removed (NC), or was
  hypothesized but not confirmed to have an atom removed (HNC).
  * qid: The "Question Identifier", or the number used to represent snippet
  sample.
  * source: The C source code of the snippet.

## Interview Instructions

### Transcripts

### Instruments

The raw instruments were originally generated with several pages that were
removed from the scans included in this package. The pages were removed for
privacy concerns or to limit redundancy, as listed below:

* Page 1: Introductory page describing the nature of the research and signature line
for informed consent [removed for privacy concerns]
* Page 2: Directions page that explains how to complete the tasks in the study
 [removed due to redundancy]
* Pages 11-12: Demographic survey [removed for privacy concerns]

An unused example copy of the instrument, as well as the latex templates that
created it are available in the _preparation_ directory of this package.

Regarding the color of writing on each page, the pen given to subjects was
changed during different phases of the study. In the beginning when subjects
were working on their own without researcher interaction, they used a black
pen. After they completed the first phase of the study and the study leader
engaged them in a dialog, they were given a red pen. When viewing the written
instruments then, black ink indicates thoughts formulated by the participant
alone, while writing in red ink may be affected by interactions with the study
leader.

\plain\fs22 Subject:            15:07          Oh, yeah, no, I'm just trying to remember. You get to the point where you stop tracking individually and I'm trying to remember if I'm [age] or [age + 1]. Um, so I was born in [year].

\plain\fs22 Subject:            16:17          During university. How many courses did you take and what you had to program? All right. So my freshman year I took cs. \cf0\cb0{\*\bkmkstart Learned by Programming:43718&Admin%^kn42uh4su-000¦}{\*\bkmkstart Learned by Reading Book:43718&Admin%^lT3hJ8XI4-000¦}So I took the SICP structure, interpretation of computer programmings.{\*\bkmkend Learned by Reading Book:43718&Admin%^lT3hJ8XI4-000¦}\li0\fi0\ri0\sb0\sa0\ql\vertalt{\*\bkmkend Learned by Programming:43718&Admin%^kn42uh4su-000¦}\li0\fi0\ri0\sb0\sa0\ql\vertalt  I took the intro to data structures. I took computer vision my sophomore year. I took compilers, I took AI databases, programming languages, computer architecture,\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Subject:            16:47          uhhhhhhhhhh, advanced vision, advanced algorithms, theory, discrete algo... Discrete and algorithmic mathematics. Um,\par

\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Interviewer:        17:07          And an approximate answer would be fine too.\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Subject:            17:09          About 10. How did you learn to program? Uh, uh, a mixture of uh, ti-81 calculator,\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Interviewer:       17:33          Basic or assembly?\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Subject:            17:36          Neither. The ti-81 had a little dedicated thing that was like kind of stripped down Basic. Where like, there were special ways to pull up the keywords into it. Um, you were only allowed the variables a through z single letter\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Interviewer:        17:48          All uppercase\par

I remember at the time I would write programs and I would just start at A and go alphabetically, like the variables had no meaning they were in order. I like somehow I still managed to write reasonably complicated programs despite this atrocious{\*\bkmkend Learned by Programming:43718&Admin%^qeqvyiFEb-000¦}\li0\fi0\ri0\sb0\sa0\ql\vertalt{\*\bkmkend Anecdote:43718&Admin%^JTEY9kYaH-000¦}\li0\fi0\ri0\sb0\sa0\ql\vertalt . Uh, and um, and I also took AP CS a few years after that. AP Computer Science. What is your preferred programming language? Oh, please, that's not a real question. You have to specify the size of the program, right? We're going to say c plus plus because that's probably what you want in this context. But like, honestly, if the program is going to be one line, I write it in Perl. If the program is going to be less than 10 lines, I write it in bash. If it's going to be less than a hundred lines, I write it in python and otherwise I read it. And C plus plus.\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Interviewer:        18:44          Okay. Um, I'd be pretty impressed though, if you have a, a one line program that is c plus plus\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Subject:            18:51          You just have to start far enough to the left and you can't have any pound includes,\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Interviewer:        18:55          Right, yeah.\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Subject:            18:57          Um, if you're, if you're currently programming on a daily basis, which language do you use, c plus plus. Think about the largest C/C++ program you have ever written or contributed to roughly how many lines is the entire codebase, oh fuck me. The [company] code base is, I forget 3 to 6 million lines or something or was it trillion? I think it's million. I'm going to say I'm going to say 6 million. But you know, you can ask [supervisor] if you want a better number. He's better at that one than I am. [Big laughter] Uh, roughly how many lines did you contribute? So this is funny. My day job is to write tools that refactor the entire code base. Um, so I have,\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Interviewer:        19:48          So this is if you blamed the code base, how many would\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Subject:            19:50          Right, so if you ran [internal company] blame on the code base, uh, you would discover my name on almost a million lines of code,\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Interviewer:        20:00          That's a pretty big contribution.\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Subject:            20:01          um, somewhere between 500,000 and a million.\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Interviewer:        20:05          So if, if this were, how many did you author by hand?\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Subject:            20:09          Ah, how many did I author by hand? That is an entirely different question,\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Interviewer:        20:12          That is an entirely different question. But for most people in the world, it's the same question.\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Subject:            20:16          Right, hence my laughter. Um, how many did I author by hand? Let's see. Oh, I've done, you know, probably 30,000 lines, of just like one offs here or there and another 30,000 lines of like dedicated, thoughtful code. So probably somewhere between 50 and 100k.\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Interviewer:        20:40          Oh, that's a great, yeah.\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Subject:            20:49          All right. How would you estimate your programming proficiency?\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Subject:            20:56          This is a funny joke in that, um, God, what's the stupid thing where like \cf0\cb0{\*\bkmkstart Quote:43718&Admin%^yeMZTxrSI-000¦}{\*\bkmkstart Experienced vs Inexperienced:43718&Admin%^QPQe9Imzw-000¦}people who are actually skilled at things underrate their proficiency because they actually know how much they don't know. Whereas like as a sophomore in college, you're like, I'm brilliant, I'm an expert.

\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Interviewer:        21:12          Um, yeah, so I think that's the Dunning Kruger effect.\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Subject:            21:15          Yes. That's the one. Anyway. Uh, I'm going to say I am expert, I am an expert in c plus plus relative to second year programming students. I'm a lot better than them relative to professional programmers. I'm, uh, well there are only six now. Now you have to get into these questions of percentiles. Um, I'm going to go with that again, but it's all rounding error in the percentiles. One of the quirks on the team I work on is I work with several people that hold reasonable claims to be the best programmer at [company]. I like, I'm not as good as them. I know that, but I also run the education for c plus plus at [company] and I know how deep the hole goes.\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Interviewer:        21:56          I see.\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Subject:            21:57          So, yeah. Have you ever been a professional programmer? Yes. For how long? All right. Well, let's see here. I graduated in '04. I don't know if we really count my internships. Let's not, Um so I graduated in '04 and I've been a professional programmer since, so we'll call it 15 years.\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Subject:            22:20          Have you ever been a professional programmer using primarily, yes. Uh, how long? Um, let's see. So at [company], I've been using c plus plus the entire time, which is five years. And then before [company] I was working in Java, but before Java, although, like I spent a quarter of that working in c plus plus probably not enough to count. And then before that I was working on robotics, which were in c plus plus. And that was about three years. So we'll say a total of eight years\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Subject:            22:47          Continued on the next page, please list each programming language use you've used along with the year, which you learned, the number of years you've spent actively working with the language and an estimate of the total number of lines of code you've written for each [whistles]. All right. So, um, I learned c plus plus, uh, in 1999 it was quite a party, uh, and worked actively in it from 1999. So this started, that was AP, c plus plus uh, then I used it at my internships in college and on through, uh, up to the end of my robotics. So till 2007, so it was about eight years during which time I wrote. I honestly couldn't tell you, probably not that much code proooobably 20 k lines over the entire time, but God really knows, uh, uh, notes, what book? Uh,\cf0\cb0{\*\bkmkstart Learned by Reading Book:43718&Admin%^NGl4iXRDb-000¦}{\*\bkmkstart C vs C++:43718&Admin%^n7QOn4efE-000¦}{\*\bkmkstart Anecdote:43718&Admin%^8tlhZ2bIB-000¦} I really like Bruce Eckle's Thinking in C++ was like the keystone book for me and it was entirely because of the pdf was available for free.\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Subject:            24:04          It was actually interesting because I had originally learned C plus plus at, uh in the AP course and Bruce Eckle's thinking in c plus plus is designed to be a course to teach C programmers how to use C plus plus, but I didn't know C and I ended up reading it and learning how C works. It was really fun. That actually helped me a great deal when I took a compiler's course a few years later\cf0\cb0{\*\bkmkend Anecdote:43718&Admin%^8tlhZ2bIB-000¦}\li0\fi0\ri0\sb0\sa0\ql\vertalt{\*\bkmkend C vs C++:43718&Admin%^n7QOn4efE-000¦}\li0\fi0\ri0\sb0\sa0\ql\vertalt{\*\bkmkend Learned by Reading Book:43718&Admin%^NGl4iXRDb-000¦}\li0\fi0\ri0\sb0\sa0\ql\vertalt . Uh, all right. And then I worked in Java from, uh, 2007 through 2012 ish. Oh, when did I, what did I learn Java? Well, I took a couple of Java courses in college, um, which was probably a 2002. Um, but I was active in Java for like seven years.\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Subject:            24:57          Um, uh, and during that time I probably wrote about 50 k lines. Um, I was pretty productive at that startup. Um, I didn't really use any books for it cause I'm not really a book learner for the most part. Um, right. And then after Java I went back to c plus plus at [company] and obviously I learned it above, but I spent another five years doing it, and during which time I produced a bunch of code and I even estimated over here. Yeah, somewhere in the 50 to 100 k range.\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Interviewer:        25:39          Nice use of dynamic programming.\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Subject:            25:44          Indeed. Uh, this was a return after joining [company]\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Subject:            25:57          and it was kind of like a really different language. Like in some ways it was c plus plus 11 when I came back to [company] or when I came to [company], I've been at [company], well, let's see, it's 2019. I've been at [company] a touch over five years, which would have put it 2014, did I start 2014 or 2013? Probably 2014 but it might have been 2013. All right.

\plain\fs22 Subject:            26:31          All languages are deeply, deeply flawed and anyone who thinks their language cannot be improved has not really used it. Um, yeah, one of my favorite interview questions is what language do you know best? How would you change it if you had full control over it?\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Interviewer:        26:48          Yeah. Do you do interviewing?\par

\plain\fs22 Subject:            26:51          When I can't avoid it? I did it a lot more at startups where [company]'s interview process. I'm not huge on it [laughs]. I did it more at startups. When like it mattered a lot more.\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Interviewer:        27:05          Yeah, that's certainly true. Each incremental employee is a bigger percentage of the entire employee pool.\par

\plain\fs22 Interviewer:        29:19          Um, well the funny thing about Ternary is, uh, it doesn't just have one precedence, but in all cases the answer is yeah, it does. Um, well, so I also, one other question, not related to either of these in particular, but you keep using the phrase the phrase "special form".\par

Um, so in, if we go to c plus plus prior to c plus plus 11, right? [Writes on back of page, last page in pdf] If you had Foo where Foo was a complex type A equals something, um, this is not defined to be operator equals it is defined to be a constructor is a constructor that is implicit for whatever this type is. And it doesn't actually have to be strings. It's just the common case where this happens is where you have stood string S equals "hi there".{\*\bkmkend History Lesson:43718&Admin%^Hiw4GFt6u-000¦}\li0\fi0\ri0\sb0\sa0\ql\vertalt\par

\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Subject:            30:25          And so it's, right, there's sort of a rewrite rule that the compiler or applies\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Interviewer:        30:30          And so that, that's the special form.\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Subject:            30:32          Yeah. Um, the other case where things that are occasionally special forms come up is, uh, I mean macros can all be considered a special form, but they're just macros. They're weird. But like, um, certain system things like memcpy, although the parser doesn't treat them as a special form, the optimizer does.\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Interviewer:        30:50          Oh, that's interesting. Okay.\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Subject:            30:52          Like memcpy, the optimizer is allowed to be like I have seen deep into the soul of your code and I have taken out all the calls to memcopy. Because I can.\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Interviewer:        31:00          Um, so is is that phrase itself special form? Is that like an official C plus plus term?\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Subject:            31:09          No, it's a programming languages term.\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Interviewer:        31:10          Okay. Cause yeah, I'm familiar with it from Lisp primarily because you have S-expressions and, well I guess everything's an S-expression, but um, you have like function application and then special forms and so that, that's actually the only time I've ever seen it. That term used actually\par

But lisp actually needs to say the arguments to if are not laz.. are lazily, evaluated, not eagerly evaluated, which means you can't implement it as a function in the language. You have to implement it directly into the compiler as a special form that{\*\bkmkend Haskell:43718&Admin%^hYVsaSO6C-000¦}\li0\fi0\ri0\sb0\sa0\ql\vertalt\par

\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Interviewer:        31:56          Yeah. Well, but, um, so I think lisp distinguishes between special forms and macros\par

\plain\fs22 Subject:            32:06          The only list I've worked with is, um, Scheme, which I don't even remember if scheme has macros. They didn't cover it and structure an interpretation of computer programming.\par

\plain\fs22 Interviewer:        32:17          They didn't. Um, um, but yeah, actually if any flavor of lisp was not going to have special forms, it would be scheme.\par

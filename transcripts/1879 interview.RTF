\plain\fs22 Subject:            21:22          Yes. So let's say that in 1989 I started getting paid. I think that's about right. So, uh, that is 29 years.\par

\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Subject:            23:32          Yeah, it is something I have no idea. When I picked up perl, um, let's call it. Oh, I forgot to m4, m4 was cool. Um, I stopped programming in perl around 2010. So it's, call it 15 years. Python, R about about 2 thousand.... 10. I don't know. I don't really remember when I picked up Python?

Let me tell you the thing about it. So they are basically, there are basically three error messages. Okay. Uh, uh, one is backtick NYI, not yet implemented. And I think it should be not implemented yet, but they, even their grammar is wrong. So then the other one is backtick NV, which is like not a variable or something. Um, and then the other one is backtick, which basically means you screwed up somewhere. And it's literally that because there is no, none of these error messages have a line number or a column where the error happened. All you get is the error message. Nothing else.\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Interviewer:        25:36          Is that because for some reason it's impossible or difficult to tell where it happened?\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par

\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Subject:            25:44          Yes. But the other one, the other thing that is awesome is there are seven functions that you call all the time. And this is an interpreter language. So looking at functions is really expensive or so they think at least. Um, so they put these functions in the same place in the symbol table every time. And you can call them by saying bang, exclamation mark minus one that calls the first one of those functions or bang minus three that calls the third one of those functions. I don't know what these functions do, but they must be really important.\par

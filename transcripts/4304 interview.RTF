I still has like a very strong history of, it's like association with the, with the um, like low level program. It's meant for implementing operating systems. Yeah, for sure. And so a lot of the code has like, you know, the operators are all like things that are one-to-one with what's in the ALU and this whole pre-increment post-increment, which is like, uh many languages copied it. But it really comes from the hardware would do this.

And it's, is it possible you would get to the point here where like that you are asking to print out a value that isn't initialized and whether or not an uninitialized value is defined is depends on them. Like a, it depends on the C, the, uh, the flavor of C that you're actually working in. Um, actually I don't know for even today, I'm not sure if like the default, initiali... I think that since um in c plus plus 11, they, uh, made sure that like, um, these are default initialized, so they'd be zero. But that's not guaranteed in the early, like early versions of C this is a frequent cause of errors is like people didn't initialize their variables, so they get, or they might either be assigned something by, it's implemation, implementation defined. And so you could have like, um, random values. Um, but here it seems like every code path does do an assignment to both of the variables. And so these are all kind of all kind of the same flavor at this point. Where you like and here, um, the assignment of this, it can only be either this value of that value.{\*\bkmkend History Lesson:43713&Admin%^8ok0XFiXw-000¦}\li0\fi0\ri0\sb0\sa0\ql\vertalt{\*\bkmkend Uninitialized:43713&Admin%^PgoyJUpFR-000¦}\li0\fi0\ri0\sb0\sa0\ql\vertalt  So I guess, yeah, now that, uh, umm, yeah. {\*\bkmkstart Comma Operator Atom:43713&Admin%^1S4rdpP2p-000¦}{\*\bkmkstart Correct Semantics:43713&Admin%^Ynmt1XhvY-000¦}{\*\bkmkstart Inferring Semantics from Reasoning:43713&Admin%^Xk1Fuagzc-000¦}{\*\bkmkstart Lisp:43713&Admin%^YIKnYq0Cp-000¦}{\*\bkmkstart Contrasting different languages:43713&Admin%^MsxTkrQ3a-000¦}Well the comma operator's almost, it's definitely going to return the last value.{\*\bkmkend Correct Semantics:43713&Admin%^Ynmt1XhvY-000¦}\li0\fi0\ri0\sb0\sa0\ql\vertalt{\*\bkmkend Comma Operator Atom:43713&Admin%^1S4rdpP2p-000¦}\li0\fi0\ri0\sb0\sa0\ql\vertalt  It wouldn't make sense to return something earlier.{\*\bkmkend Inferring Semantics from Reasoning:43713&Admin%^Xk1Fuagzc-000¦}\li0\fi0\ri0\sb0\sa0\ql\vertalt  I think that like is perhaps to related to like the association with lisp where you had like you can chain together a whole bunch of evaluations.

\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Interviewer:        25:20          Yeah. Um, cool. Um, I, to to my way of thinking about it though, I actually have sort of a different, um, way of conceptualizing the comma operator. So everything you said is true, but, um, the way that you associated with functional code, for me personally, it's a personal thing. I associate it with imperative code. Um, cause you were talking about like I don't know if there's any reason to use it and I've sort of thought a lot about this and I think the only reasons that I can come up with why anybody would ever want to use the camera operator are sort of an imperative contexts. So one time that I've seen comma operator used a lot is if, let's say you're using like a while-loop or a for-loop and you sorta want to jam multiple things, um,\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Subject:            26:09          Oh that's true. I mean the for. Yeah. Like for like you can do like that that's actually a, it is using the comma operator, but you don't often use the result of the, right. You're just kind of taking advantage of that. You can pack multiple assignments together, uh, into a chain like that.\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Interviewer:        26:25          Right. Exactly. Yeah. So\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Subject:            26:28          A equals B comma C equals D comma D equals E.\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Interviewer:        26:31          Yeah, sorta tonight. Yeah. So it, it, it's almost sort of like the, the semi colon except it's in a single expression instead of in a statement. Um,\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Subject:            26:38          And then so there was the fact that it returns, the last expression is kind of just like the consequences that it has to something\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Interviewer:        26:45          Something. Yeah. Right. Um, so, so it's sort of a choice. Um, it could be either of them, it could even return zero or an arbitrary value and it wouldn't really matter because all, all it's doing is sort of executing multiple things, which is something that you really only need to do in nonfunctional programs, um, when, when you're executing for side effects.\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Subject:            27:03          Yes\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Interviewer:        27:03          So, that's one context. And then I think the other context in which I've seen it, um, is it also sort of has like another side effect, which is that, um, it serves as like a sequence point. So they're like,\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Subject:            27:16          It's like the lowest precedence operator, or one of the lowest. And that seems like it was like, well, everything else was higher. I thought, maybe not.\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Interviewer:        27:24          Well, so it's funny you say that because even in this context, even even between these, um, parentheses, well I guess no. Yeah, you're right. It is, it is lower than equal. So yeah, I guess it is pretty low. It's not lower than semi-colon\par

\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Interviewer:        27:51          Yeah, yeah. Um, well I think that actually changes the\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Subject:            27:54          It does change the semantics and like, so it would be like V, both V1 and V2 equal one, right. And comma 2 just means, oh, by the way,\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Interviewer:        28:00          there's also a two.\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Subject:            28:01          Yeah. Right.\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Interviewer:        28:03          Um, yeah, that would be weird. Um, but, but the other thing that the comma does is, um, for example, the, uh, the post increment operators, um,\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Subject:            28:14          Plus plus A plus comma plus plus B like, they chain them together, like if you're doing, if you're doing like you're doing parallel, a very common, I think they're very common. It was like doing, uh, um, a buffer copy where you have two pointers. And by the way, you didn't have anything. \cf0\cb0{\*\bkmkstart Potential Confusing Constructs:43713&Admin%^c0aBdtbiZ-000¦}I was expecting lots of pointers.{\*\bkmkend Potential Confusing Constructs:43713&Admin%^c0aBdtbiZ-000¦}\li0\fi0\ri0\sb0\sa0\ql\vertalt\par

But if you're doing, if you're doing two pointers and you were having them both run in parallel, it'd be very typical to use to comma operator to join the increments.{\*\bkmkend Comma Operator Atom:43713&Admin%^RosfyAaau-000¦}\li0\fi0\ri0\sb0\sa0\ql\vertalt{\*\bkmkend Common Pattern:43713&Admin%^M4SlvqjHx-000¦}\li0\fi0\ri0\sb0\sa0\ql\vertalt\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Interviewer:        28:41          Yeah. Um, but so one, one, one feature of the comma operator, especially in those contexts is that, um, you know, so, so the post increment returns, it's value and then increments later, um, and normally that increments later happens, um, at the end of the line, like after the semi colon, it's when the statement finishes, that's when it's incremented.\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par

\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Interviewer:        29:12          Exactly. Um, and because it's actually undefined within, within what's called a sequence point. It's undefined.\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Subject:            29:19          UB?\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Interviewer:        29:20          Yeah. Um, but a comma is a place where that gets resolved. So when you come to a comma, the incrementation actually happens. And then afterwards, if you reference the variable, if you read the value afterwards, it has already resolved, it has already incremented, so then it's suddenly defined behavior again.\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Subject:            29:45          Okay.\cf0\cb0{\*\bkmkstart Potential Confusing Constructs:43713&Admin%^fqxrJT0ch-000¦} I wouldn't have known that.

\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Subject:            36:54          Um, and actually it's one of the things about c plus, but you'll hear people like say, Oh, I'm going to introduce another abstraction and to create a wrapper. And like that seems like it'd be the first thing that everybody wants to do for anything is to like introduce a new abstraction. And that's Kinda like a c plus plus chimerical nature is like you. Like it seems like that's it. It's odd that that seems like the thing to do. Uh, like in the or languages that are more formalized, you know, like, like in, in Java, uh, I think like I look at like cryptography or something like that.

\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Subject:            37:38          But that kind of leads all of these things kind of coalesced together because like the entire, you know, Java's class loader is very rich and the idea that like somebody is going to provide you a library, it's going to do the job that works. You know, at most projects at [company] are these fat binaries that we compile like, you know, millions of lines of code.

So the first bike shedding where a lot of people that will always disagree, is like should you do like, do the expression that does this, you know, the expression that does the assignment and evaluations separately or not. So we just simply say V2 equals 1 and now you say if V2 is equal to 1, which also means now you see this silliness kind of in it. But it might make sense if this is a function, right?

\plain\fs22 Subject:            18:51          How did you learn to program? Ooh, I think my first thing is like as a kid I got a TRS 80 I got, that was awesome.

\plain\fs22 Subject:            19:54          I Dunno, I'm just going to say millions. Millions. I don't know how many. Wow. Must've been. I know it's somewhere. I mean I can look this up. How many lines of code? But um, I would say just by heart. I would say 100,000. How would you estimate your programming proficiency? Please uh, I'm going to be overconfident here. Expert, expert relativity. Oh God. Six is professional programmers. I think I'm just going to be like top five something like, uh, if you ever been here. Yes. Yes. If so for how long? Oh, that's a long time old fella. Who was my first one? What's the first year I actually made money doing it. As a student. I would say '91, so that makes it, uh, 28 years. Wow. Um, yes. So for how long? I think my c plus plus proficiency started, well let's say 20 years\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Subject:            21:35          primarily continued on next page you've used along with the year, which you learned it, the number of years you spent actively working with the language and then, uh Huh. Alright. So the language, C, Gosh, that would be my first c program was Borland and I did that when I worked for [company]. That must've been like 90, 91 that was probably the one of the first, you know what, I'm just going to give that 90 so that makes that 20, uh, 59 number of lines. Wow. I mean overall the years, I'm just going to say anything to two to 300 k no notes.\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Subject:            22:40          Well of course I have to say I read the key, the K&R, give you some notes just for kicks. Uh, okay. And are and my first, okay.\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Subject:            22:54          First C compiler I ever, worked with that I can recall is Borland's, c/c plus plus. I think that was the c plus plus already. And I think it was 1.3. So I would actually call it C/C plus plus. Um, oh, I should also injects so now I'm going to mess up the order. Pascal! [Loudly]\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Subject:            23:25          So yeah, Pascal learned in year, I would say 86, number of active years. I don't call that active, but let's say. Four years, number of lines of code. Maybe one K at [university], used pascal as uh, it's one of their languages. Uh, Java, when it did I learn Java? That's probably somewhere in the 2000 somewhere. Did they reactively used it a little bit. Let me put 19 in front of that. I have this goal that 2000 X X ish. Active years, I've used this at [company] as well. So I would say total.\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Subject:            24:28          Uh, I say 10 years. Number of lines of code probably adds up, not too much. 20 k uh, mostly intermittent. Okay. C sharp. Let me try it to be accurate here. I've used C sharp before that already I say 2004 I don't use that active anymore. But I would call that 8 years. I'd say code should be pretty impressive there on 100 k. Um, yeah, that's actually all languages that I can think off the things like Javascript, bah. Ah, yeah, bash not a language. I'm not going to list Go or other stuff. I don't do really much too much in there.

\plain\fs22 Interviewer:        27:39          Well, but that's neither rounding, ceil, or floor because for negative numbers, um, truncation, is a ceil. But for positive numbers it's a floor.

\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par

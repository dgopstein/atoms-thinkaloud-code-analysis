\plain\fs22 Interviewer:        31:37          Um, and so what would be your confidence? Oh yeah, like unsure.\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Interviewer:        31:40          Okay. Cool. Um, so I guess one other question I have is, um, it sounded like you do see, um, uh, defines in code.\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Subject:            31:53          Yeah.\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Interviewer:        31:53          Um, have you ever seen anything akin to this?\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Subject:            31:58          I, uh, both internally and externally. I've never seen a define that overwrites a previously defined macro without first undefining it.\par
\pard\plain\plain\fs22\par
\plain\fs22 Interviewer:        32:10          Ah, I see.\par

Um, and I was under the impression that the reason you have to undefine it just so that the next time you define it's safe to do, maybe that's only for like function macros. Uh, but, uh, yeah, that's like, like redefinitions of macros, that's the only like context where I feel like I've seen it.{\*\bkmkend Notices Atom:43719&Admin%^cDoNucAyK-000¦The participant is intimately familiar with the pattern we're effectively referencing, except they are so familiar that they only know the safe version. }\li0\fi0\ri0\sb0\sa0\ql\vertalt\par

\plain\fs22 Interviewer:        32:51          Sure. Yeah. Okay, great. Yeah, I don't think I have any other questions. Um, it turns out that, uh, it does, uh, just overwrite.\par

\plain\fs22 Interviewer:        33:10          So I limited this to C, but I feel like features like that C plus plus tries to keep them backwards compatible. We can Google and find out,\par

\plain\fs22 Interviewer:        33:18          Well in C, but I don't know about c plus plus, so we could go find out about that. Um, but, okay. So, um, we can sort of have a meta-discussion about this whole thing, but do you have any more on the record questions about this piece of code or about\par
